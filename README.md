pageCub
=======

A WYSIWYG website editor for quick and easy website development with Bootstrap.

This is a work-in-progress. I am looking to make this a solid standalone product that will live at pagecub.com. My wishlist: 

* Output the HTML to a .html file
* Implement a stack for full UNDO functionality
* Allow starting with a layout template
* Support theming
* Support more HTML elements
* Allow users to save and restore their work

Please let me know if you would like to help make this happen. I'm @decktonic

p.s. I have no idea why the Bootstrap Glyphicons do not show up! I am using the NetDNA CDN to load the latest version of Bootstrap (3.1.0) and the glyphicons should be displaying in the pnotify errors but they do not and I have no idea why.
