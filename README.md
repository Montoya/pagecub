A WYSIWYG website editor for quick and easy website development with Bootstrap.

This project was never completed, but it's an interesting exploration of what can be done with pure HTML5. Missing features:

* Output the HTML to a .html file
* Implement a stack for full UNDO functionality
* Allow starting with a layout template
* Support theming
* Support more HTML elements
* Allow users to save and restore their work

Anyway, feel free to take this and do something cool with it!
